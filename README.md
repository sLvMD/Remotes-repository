Programming is like poetry,

A dance with lines of code,

A symphony of logic,

A story to be told.<br>



With every keystroke,

A new verse takes shape,

A world of possibility,

A program to escape.


From the simple to the complex,

Each line a work of art,

A puzzle to be solved,

A journey to depart.


With each bug squashed,

A victory is won,

A masterpiece complete,

A job well done.


For the coder, the artist,

With a passion to create,

Programming is a form of expression,

A way to innovate.


So let the code flow,

Like a river through the land,

For in the world of programming,

A new story is at hand.
